The above code is the implementation of the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.02164.pdf , the code involves the implementation using the pretrained model of VGG16,
the libraries of numpy, scipy and sklearn have been utilized to complete the implementation.

The basic structure of the code is as follows,
1) We get the necessary details of the similarity matrix that is talked about in the paper from the authors github profile
